<p> Hi. My name is Allan. This is my story. I am 22 years old. Parents originally from China. I can speak English, Mandarin, and Teochew. I went to Northwestern Univeristy and majored in Biological Sciences. I currently live in Newton, MA. After I graduated school, I taught English in Songyuan (a city in Northern China) as well as Tianjin (a city in Middle China) and Shantou (where my family originally is from). In my spare time, I like to play basketball, eat a lot of chicken, and run. </p>
